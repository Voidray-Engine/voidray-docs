# Game Development Concepts for Beginners

New to game development? This guide explains the core concepts you need to understand to use VoidRay effectively. Don't worry - we'll keep it simple!

## 🎮 What is a Game Engine?

Think of a game engine like a **toolbox for making games**. Instead of building everything from scratch (like drawing pixels on screen one by one), the engine handles the hard technical stuff so you can focus on making your game fun.

**VoidRay provides:**
- A way to draw sprites (game characters/objects) on screen
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
- Physics simulation (objects bouncing, gravity, collisions)
- Audio system (music and sound effects)
- Scene management (different game screens)

**You provide:**
- The game idea and rules
- Art and sound assets
- Game logic (what happens when player jumps, etc.)

## 🧩 Key Concepts Explained Simply

### Game Objects
**What:** Everything in your game world  
**Examples:** Player character, enemies, bullets, coins, platforms, even invisible controllers  
**In VoidRay:** Use `Sprite` for visible objects, `GameObject` for invisible ones

```python
# Visible game object
player = Sprite("Player")
player.create_colored_rect(40, 40, Color.BLUE)

# Invisible game object (like a game controller)
game_manager = GameObject("GameManager")
```

### Components
**What:** Pieces of functionality you attach to game objects  
**Think of it like:** Adding parts to a car - engine for movement, radio for sound, etc.  
**Examples:** Physics (makes objects fall), Collision (detects when things touch), Custom behaviors

```python
# Add physics to make an object fall
rigidbody = Rigidbody()
player.add_component(rigidbody)

# Add collision detection
collider = BoxCollider(40, 40)
player.add_component(collider)
```

### Scenes
**What:** Different "screens" or "levels" in your game  
**Examples:** Main menu, Level 1, Game over screen, Settings menu  
**In VoidRay:** Each scene contains its own game objects and logic

```python
class MenuScene(Scene):
    def on_enter(self):
        # Create menu buttons
        pass

class GameScene(Scene):
    def on_enter(self):
        # Create player, enemies, level
        pass
```

### Transforms
**What:** Where objects are in the game world (position, rotation, size)  
**Every object has one:** Even if you don't see it, every game object has a transform  
**Like:** GPS coordinates, compass direction, and size all in one

```python
# Move object to position (100, 200)
player.transform.position = Vector2(100, 200)

# Rotate object 45 degrees
player.transform.rotation = 45

# Make object twice as big
player.transform.scale = Vector2(2.0, 2.0)
```

### Delta Time
**What:** How much time passed since the last frame  
**Why important:** Makes movement smooth regardless of frame rate  
**Simple rule:** Always multiply movement by delta_time

```python
# Wrong - movement depends on frame rate
player.transform.position.x += 5

# Right - smooth movement regardless of frame rate
player.transform.position.x += speed * delta_time
```

## 🔄 How Games Work (The Game Loop)

Every game runs the same basic loop over and over, many times per second:

```
1. Get Input (What did the player do?)
   ↓
2. Update Game (Move objects, check rules)
   ↓
3. Draw Everything (Show the current state)
   ↓
4. Repeat (Usually 60 times per second)
```

**In your VoidRay code:**
```python
def update(self, delta_time):
    # Step 2: Update game logic
    self.handle_movement()
    self.check_collisions()

def render(self, renderer):
    # Step 3: Draw custom UI
    renderer.draw_text("Score: 100", Vector2(10, 10), Color.WHITE)
```

## 🎯 Coordinate System

**Understanding where things are on screen:**

```
(0,0) ──────────────── (800,0)
  │                        │
  │     Your Game          │
  │      Screen            │
  │                        │
  │                        │
(0,600) ──────────────── (800,600)
```

- **X axis:** Left to right (0 = left edge, 800 = right edge)
- **Y axis:** Top to bottom (0 = top edge, 600 = bottom edge)
- **Center of 800x600 screen:** (400, 300)

## 🏗️ Building Your First Game - Step by Step

### 1. Start Simple
Begin with basic colored shapes before using fancy graphics:
```python
# Use simple shapes first
player.create_colored_rect(40, 40, Color.BLUE)
enemy.create_colored_circle(20, Color.RED)
```

### 2. One Feature at a Time
Don't try to build everything at once:
1. First: Make something appear on screen
2. Then: Make it move
3. Then: Add controls
4. Then: Add collision
5. Continue step by step...

### 3. Test Often
Run your game after each small change to catch problems early.

### 4. Use Print Statements
Debug by printing values to see what's happening:
```python
print(f"Player position: {player.transform.position}")
print(f"Score: {self.score}")
```

## 🎮 Common Game Patterns

### Player Movement
```python
def handle_movement(self, delta_time):
    input_mgr = voidray.get_engine().input_manager
    movement = Vector2.zero()
    
    if input_mgr.is_key_pressed(Keys.LEFT):
        movement.x = -1
    if input_mgr.is_key_pressed(Keys.RIGHT):
        movement.x = 1
    
    # Apply movement
    velocity = movement * self.speed * delta_time
    self.transform.position += velocity
```

### Collision Detection
```python
def on_collision(self, other, collision_info):
    if "Enemy" in other.game_object.name:
        print("Player hit enemy!")
        self.take_damage()
    elif "Coin" in other.game_object.name:
        print("Collected coin!")
        other.game_object.destroy()
        self.score += 10
```

### Spawning Objects
```python
def spawn_enemy(self):
    enemy = Enemy()
    enemy.transform.position = Vector2(800, 300)  # Right side of screen
    self.scene.add_object(enemy)
```

## 🐛 Common Beginner Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting Delta Time
```python
# Wrong - choppy movement
position.x += 5

# Right - smooth movement
position.x += speed * delta_time
```

### 2. Not Checking If Objects Exist
```python
# Wrong - might crash
self.player.score += 10

# Right - safe
if self.player:
    self.player.score += 10
```

### 3. Creating Objects Every Frame
```python
# Wrong - creates hundreds of bullets per second
def update(self, delta_time):
    if self.shooting:
        bullet = Bullet()  # Creates new bullet every frame!

# Right - one bullet per button press
def update(self, delta_time):
    if input_mgr.is_key_just_pressed(Keys.SPACE):
        bullet = Bullet()  # One bullet per press
```

### 4. Not Removing Destroyed Objects
```python
# Objects that go off-screen should be destroyed
def update(self, delta_time):
    if self.transform.position.y > 700:  # Below screen
        self.destroy()  # Remove to save memory
```
